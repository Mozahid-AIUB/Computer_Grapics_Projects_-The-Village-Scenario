# 🌾 Village Scenario – Computer Graphics Project (C++, OpenGL)

This project simulates a **2D animated village scene** using **OpenGL (GLUT)** in C++. It was developed as part of the Computer Graphics course at **American International University–Bangladesh (AIUB)**, Spring 2024–2025.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to create a visually engaging and interactive village environment featuring day-night cycles, weather effects, and animated elements.

## 👨‍💻 Developed By

  **ID**: 23-51293-1  
  **Section**: O  
  **Group**: 10  
  **Supervised by**: *Aneem Al Ahsan Rupai*

## 🌄 Key Features

- 🌞 **Day and Night Modes** – Switch between sun and moon scenes via keyboard ('D' / 'N')
- 🌧️ **Rain Animation** – Activate rain using 'R' key
- ☁️ **Moving Clouds** – Dynamic sky with smooth cloud transitions
- 🐦 **Flying Birds** – Animated birds in flight
- ⛵ **Boat Animation** – Multiple boats moving across the river
- 🌳 **Village Elements** – Huts, trees, well, fences, and straw piles
- 🎵 **Sound Effects** – Birds chirping, cricket sounds, and rain ambience
- 🌼 **Interactive Grass and Flowers** – Enhanced realism and aesthetics

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Graphics Library**: OpenGL (GLUT)
- **Tools**: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio (recommended for OpenGL projects)

## 🧠 Function List (Object Rendering)

The following OpenGL functions were used to draw and animate objects:

- `cloud1()`, `cloud2()`, `cloud3()`
- `sky()`, `sky2()`
- `backgroundtree()`, `bird()`, `stars()`, `sun()`, `moon()`
- `ground()`, `river()`, `hut()`, `hut1()`, `tree()`
- `boat()`, `boat2()`, `boat3()`, `boat4()`
- `Straw()`, `way()`, `fence()`, `well()`, `well1()`
- `grass1()` to `grass6()`

### 🔁 Animation Functions:

- `cloud(int)`, `birdd(int)`, `sunn(int)`, `boat(int)`, `rain(int)`

### 💡 Utility Functions:

- `PointLight()`, `StartingText()`, `DrawSphere()`, `display()` etc.
